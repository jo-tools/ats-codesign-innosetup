## Description
Are you distributing Windows Software outside of the Microsoft Store? For your users best experience and confidence, your applications should be codesigned.

This example shows how to codesign using [Azure Trusted Signing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/trusted-signing).  
Codesigning is using [jsign](https://github.com/ebourg/jsign) in a Docker Container [`jotools/ats-codesign`](https://hub.docker.com/r/jotools/ats-codesign). This allows codesigning to be performed on a host machine running on either Windows, macOS or Linux.

#### Requirements

- Set up [Azure Trusted Signing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/trusted-signing)  
  To [get you started]((https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/trusted-signing/quickstart)) have a look at the included [docs](./docs/).  
  You'll find some useful links and archived Web content there.
- Have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) up and running

## Docker Images

While the included example project is written with [Xojo](https://www.xojo.com/) you can use this approach with any other development environment.

### ATS CodeSign `jotools/ats-codesign`

Please refer to the [Documentation](./dockerimage/ats-codesign/) for the provided [Docker Image `jotools/ats-codesign`](./dockerimage/ats-codesign/). It includes information about how to set it all up, along with a codesigning example.

### ATS InnoSetup `jotools/ats-innosetup`

Please refer to the [Documentation](./dockerimage/ats-innosetup/) for the provided [Docker Image `jotools/ats-innosetup`](./dockerimage/ats-innosetup/). It includes information about how to set it all up, along with an example to create a *(codesigned)* Windows installer.

## Xojo Example Project

This repository includes a Xojo Example Project `ATS CodeSign Docker.xojo_project` which
- uses a Post Build Script `AzureTrustedSigning` to codesign the Windows builds using [Azure Trusted Signing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/trusted-signing)
- uses a Docker Container ([jotools/ats-codesign](https://hub.docker.com/r/jotools/ats-codesign)) to perform the codesigning using [jsign](https://github.com/ebourg/jsign)

This allows the Windows application to be built and codesigned with the Xojo IDE running on all Windows, macOS or Linux.

## Xojo
### Requirements
[Xojo](https://www.xojo.com/) is a rapid application development for Desktop, Web, Mobile & Raspberry Pi.  

The Desktop application Xojo example project `ATS CodeSign Docker.xojo_project` and its Post Build Script is using:
- Xojo 2024r4.2
- API 2

### How to use in your own Xojo project?
1. Create a Post Build Script in your project and copy-and-paste the example Post Build Script `AzureTrustedSigning` provided in `ATS CodeSign Docker.xojo_project`
3. Make sure this Post Build Script runs after the Step 'Windows: Build'
4. Read the comments in the provided Post Build Script, modify it according to your needs  
   The default settings are:
   - use the Docker Container [`jotools/ats-codesign`](https://hub.docker.com/r/jotools/ats-codesign)
     - *you might want to build your own Docker Container and use that one instead*
   - Codesign Final and Beta Builds
     - *no Codesigning for Alpha- and Development Builds*
   - Codesign all `.exe` and `.dll` files for Final Builds
     - *Codesign just all `.exe`, but not the `.dll` files for Beta/Alpha/Development Builds*
