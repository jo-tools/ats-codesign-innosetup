## Description
Are you distributing Windows Software outside of the Microsoft Store? For your users best experience and confidence, your applications should shipped as a windows installer and be codesigned.

### Codesigning
This example shows how to codesign using 
- [Azure Trusted Signing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/trusted-signing)
- a codesigning certificate `.pfx`

Codesigning is using [jsign](https://github.com/ebourg/jsign) in a Docker Container [`jotools/codesign`](https://hub.docker.com/r/jotools/codesign). This allows codesigning to be performed on a host machine running on either Windows, macOS or Linux.

#### Requirements

- Set up Codesigning with one of the following
  - [Azure Trusted Signing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/trusted-signing)  
    To [get you started]((https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/trusted-signing/quickstart)) have a look at the included [docs](./docs/).  
    You'll find some useful links and archived Web content there.
  - Codesign certificate `.pfx`
- Codesigning `.json`configuration files
  - See the [provided template configuration files](./docs/)

- Have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) up and running

### InnoSetup
This example shows how build a *(codesigned)* windows installer using [InnoSetup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).  
Creating the windows installer is being done in a Docker Container [`jotools/innosetup`](https://hub.docker.com/r/jotools/innosetup). This allows creating the windows installer on a host machine running on either Windows, macOS or Linux.

#### Requirements

- Optional: Set up Codesigning
- Have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) up and running


## Docker Images

While the included example project is written with [Xojo](https://www.xojo.com/) you can use this approach with any other development environment.

### `jotools/codesign`

Please refer to the [Documentation](./dockerimage/codesign/) for the provided [Docker Image `jotools/codesign`](./dockerimage/codesign/). It includes information about how to set it all up, along with a codesigning example.

### `jotools/innosetup`

Please refer to the [Documentation](./dockerimage/innosetup/) for the provided [Docker Image `jotools/innosetup`](./dockerimage/innosetup/). It includes information about how to set it all up, along with an example to create a *(codesigned)* Windows installer.

## Xojo Example Project

This repository includes a Xojo Example Project `ATS CodeSign InnoSetup.xojo_project` which uses
- a Post Build Script `CodeSign` to codesign the Windows builds using [Azure Trusted Signing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/trusted-signing) *(or a codesign certificate `.pfx`)*
  - using the Docker Container [`jotools/codesign`](https://hub.docker.com/r/jotools/codesign) to perform the codesigning using [jsign](https://github.com/ebourg/jsign)
- a Post Build Script `CreateZIP` to package the built and codesigned application in a `.zip`
- a Post Build Script `InnoSetup` to build a *(codesigned)* windows installer
  - using the Docker Container [`jotools/innosetup`](https://hub.docker.com/r/jotools/innosetup) to create the windows installer with [InnoSetup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)

This allows the Windows application to be built and codesigned with the Xojo IDE running on all Windows, macOS or Linux.

## Xojo
### Requirements
[Xojo](https://www.xojo.com/) is a rapid application development for Desktop, Web, Mobile & Raspberry Pi.  

The Desktop application Xojo example project `ATS CodeSign InnoSetup.xojo_project` and its Post Build Scripts are using:
- Xojo 2024r4.2
- API 2

### How to use in your own Xojo project?

<details>

<summary>CodeSign (Azure Trusted Signing | PFX)</summary>

1. Set up the local configuration files for CodeSign.  
   The Post Build Script(s) expect the following `.json` configuration file(s):
   - [Azure Trusted Signing](./docs/ats-codesign/)
   - [Codesigning Certificate `.pfx`](./docs/pfx-codesign/)
2. Create a Post Build Script in your project and copy-and-paste the example Post Build Script `CodeSign` provided in `ATS CodeSign InnoSetup.xojo_project`
3. Make sure the Post Build Script `CodeSign` runs after the Step 'Windows: Build'
4. Read the comments in the provided Post Build Script, modify it according to your needs  
   The default settings are:
   - use the Docker Container [`jotools/codesign`](https://hub.docker.com/r/jotools/codesign)
     - *if you're using the `InnoSetup` step as well, then change it to use the Docker Container [`jotools/innosetup`](https://hub.docker.com/r/jotools/innosetup)* so that you don't need having two different Docker Images taking up space on your machine
   - Codesign Final and Beta Builds
     - *no Codesigning for Alpha- and Development Builds*
   - Codesign all `.exe` and `.dll` files for Final Builds
     - *Codesign just all `.exe`, but not the `.dll` files for Beta/Alpha/Development Builds*

</details>

<details>

<summary>CreateZIP</summary>

1. Create a Post Build Script in your project and copy-and-paste the example Post Build Script `CreateZIP` provided in `ATS CodeSign InnoSetup.xojo_project`
2. Make sure this Post Build Script runs after the Step 'Windows: Build' *(and after `AzureTrustedSigning` to ensure you zip the codesigned application)*
3. Read the comments in the provided Post Build Script, modify it according to your needs

</details>

<details>

<summary>InnoSetup</summary>

1. Copy the folder and file `_build/innosetup_universal.iss` to your project location
   - *this is a universal InnoSetup script which should fit basic Xojo built applications*
     - *it's prepared for all Windows Build Targets (WIN32, WIN64, ARM64)*
     - *it uses parameters so that it can be configured from within the Post Build Script*
   - *or use your own InnoSetup script*
2. Optional *(only if you want to codesign the Windows Installers)*:  
   Set up the local configuration files for CodeSign.  
   The Post Build Script(s) expect the following `.json` configuration file(s):
   - [Azure Trusted Signing](./docs/ats-codesign/)
   - [Codesigning Certificate `.pfx`](./docs/pfx-codesign/)
3. Create a Post Build Script in your project and copy-and-paste the example Post Build Script `InnoSetup` provided in `ATS CodeSign InnoSetup.xojo_project`
4. Make sure this Post Build Script runs after the Step 'Windows: Build' *(and after `CodeSign` to ensure you include the codesigned application in the windows installer)*
5. Read the comments in the provided Post Build Script, modify it according to your needs *(e.g. change the value of `sAPP_PUBLISHER_URL` to your own website)*  
   The example Post Build Script is designed to be quite generic and using the provided universal innosetup script will:
   - use the Docker Container [`jotools/innosetup`](https://hub.docker.com/r/jotools/innosetup)
   - create a Windows Installer for Final and Beta Builds
     - *no Windows Installer for Alpha- and Development Builds*
   - pick up necessary information from the Xojo Project *(so make sure you've filled out the values in the Xojo IDE under 'Build Settings: Windows)*, e.g.
     - `App.ProductName`, `App.CompanyName`
     - Filename of the application's `.exe`
   - picks up the configuration of `CodeSign`
     - if available, it codesigns the (Un)Installer
     - if not found, it ignores codesigning and just creates an installer

</details>

## Security Warning

The Post Build Scripts in the example project are intended as an example to demonstrate the functionality. They allow to retrieve sensitive information *(such as a Client Secret or Certificate Password)* from a plaintext `.json` configuration file, which is **not secure**.  
However, the provided Post Build Scripts also support retrieving credentials from a Secret Storage. It's highly recommended to use that approach.

If using similar logic in a production environment, make sure to implement a secure method for managing secrets to protect sensitive information.

Retrieve the secrets in the Post Build Script from a secure storage, and run the Docker Container from the script with the corresponding Environment Variables, omitting the secrets in the `.json` configuration files.  



<details>

<summary>Security Risks</summary>

Storing secrets in plaintext files poses significant security risks, including:  
- **Exposure to unauthorized users** if file permissions are not properly set.  
- **Inclusion in backups or version control** (e.g., Git), leading to unintentional leaks.  
- **Easy access for malware or attackers** on a compromised system.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Secure Alternatives</summary>

Instead of storing secrets in a `.json` configuration file, consider these more secure approaches:  

1. Use OS-Level Secret Storage  
   - **macOS**: Store secrets in **Keychain Access** and retrieve them using the `security` CLI tool.  
   - **Linux**: Use **GNOME Keyring** or **KWallet** to securely store and retrieve secrets.  
   - **Windows**: Store credentials in **Windows Credential Manager** and access them via PowerShell.  

2. Use a Secrets Manager  
   - Cloud providers like **AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or GCP Secret Manager** offer secure, centralized secret storage with access control.  
   - Local alternatives like **1Password CLI, Bitwarden CLI, or HashiCorp Vault** allow secure retrieval of secrets at runtime.
